# {frontmatter.title}

I'm a big fan of simple tools that get the job done quickly and efficiently. I
think
[Owlbear Rodeo is the best VTT](https://kennygoff.com/owlbear-rodeo-the-painless-virtual-tabletop)
because it does maps really well and then gets out of the way.

I've tried a few different token generators for VTTs and they've all had things
I liked and things I didn't like. I make
[my own TTRPG tools](https://sidequest.tools) so I figured I'd take a stab at my
perfect VTT token maker.

## The Problem

I do my monster prep in batches and I'm normally making a bunch of tokens at
once before my games. I like using official D&D monster art when available and
my players give me their own character art. I don't like fancy borders, I really
just need a plain colored border; normally black, sometimes I'll color match to
make all enemies red, all allies blue, etc.

I don't _ever_ use AI generated art but I will search around for art since most
of the time it's just for personal use at my home games. I'm not too concerned
that the art matches a specific style, just that they generally match the idea
of the monster.

Whatever I use needs to:

1. Handle a bunch of images quickly
2. Use consistent border style across all tokens
3. Make scale/positioning edits really fast
4. Retain filenames from original images

The tools I've tried normally get 2-3 of these things right, but not all and it
always makes token creation a bit of a chore.

## The Solution

I built a new tool for Sidequest Tools called
[Swift Token](https://sidequest.tools/swift-token) that is geared around solving
those 4 problems. To use the tool you:

1. Drop in one or more files
2. Apply a sane default border that is globally editable
3. Make quick repositioning and scaling edits with drag and scroll on previews
4. Export in a zip and retain the original filenames

It's pretty fast and runs all in the browser, the files don't even get uploaded
to a server, something I try to do where possible on Sidequest Tools.

## The Future

I plan on iterating on this further but right now it's already doing token
creation faster and easier than the tools I used before.

A few ideas of things I hope to tackle soon:

- Dynamic image sizes for large+ monsters
- Individual token renaming
- Reusable custom "palettes"
- Touch screen support for phones and tablets

Try it out yourself and let me know what you think!
