# {frontmatter.title}

Time to sit around the campfire and reflect on the year! 2025 was a fun year of
exploration for me when it comes to TTRPGs and GMing. At the end of 2024 I
wrapped up two long-running D&D campaigns and was eager to try out some non-D&D
TTRPGs and also start doing my own adventure design.

## Running in-person sessions

Other than a small one-shot and a hybrid session, I had never run in-person
games before 2025. At the beginning of the year I started running one-shots and
other smaller games with some friends I met at my friendly local game store,
which gave me the opportunity to experiment a bit and also run a lot of
in-person games.

My two main campaigns are still online due to players not living in the area,
but I've loved being able to run all of my one-shots and West Marches games at
my own table. The vibe of having everyone around the same table is such a great
experience that really elevates play. I started playing D&D right before locking
down for the COVID pandemic so even as a player I barely experienced in-person
play. As a GM, getting to see and react to people's energy in person beats voice
and video calls.

## Writing & publishing adventures

With the exception of the _Dragon Delves_ campaign I just started, all of the
D&D one-shots I ran this year were my own design, some of which I have since
[published](https://sidequesters.club)! I've taken a few courses with
[Storytelling Collective](https://www.storytelling-collective.com/) and learned
design and layout with the help of
[Affinity Revolution](https://affinityrevolution.com/), and am absolutely loving
it. I also have been doing a lot more map and dungeon design using cartography
style dungeons ala [Dyson](https://dysonlogos.blog/).

I've always been a person drawn to crafting the entirety of what goes into
making a _thing_ so being able to design, write, map, and layout my own work
from start to finish is a real joy.

## Systems I ran in 2025

### Shadowdark

I was really interested in _Shadowdark_ as a new fantasy d20 game and fell in
love immediately. I ran a two-shot of
[Lost Citadel of the Scarlet Minotaur](https://www.thearcanelibrary.com/collections/shadowdark-rpg/products/shadowdark-rpg-quickstart-set-pdf)
and had a blast, even though I definitely ran a bunch of the rules completely
incorrectly. Not long after that I was toying with the idea of running a West
Marches game and the Kickstarter preview for Western Reaches had just gone live
and so I decided to go with _Shadowdark_ instead of D&D.

I highly recommend _Shadowdark_ to anyone who is familiar with D&D 5e and wants
to try something familiar feeling but different enough in tone and feel. I've
also heard it's very good for new players and one-shots as the mechanics are
simpler than 5e, although I've mostly run it with experienced players.

### Blades in the Dark

I ran a 4-session campaign of Blades as well as a one-shot and it quickly became
one of my favorite systems. Possibly my favorite as a pure design and mechnanic,
even though I still play d20 fantasy more. It balances narrative-forward play
with clever mechanics in a way that just hits a sweet spot for me and I
absolutely love the stress and trauma system. I _just_ got the physical copy of
_Deep Cuts_ and I'm excited to dive back into Doskvol.

### Kids on Bikes

I also ran a 4-session campaign of a very silly 80s Scooby Doo-esque _Kids on
Bikes_ game. The antagonists went from literally a "guy in a mask" to a real
cryptid and it was incredibly fun and ended with a homecoming dance. That
campaign I really put my players more in the drivers seat of storybuilding as we
had a full worldbuilding session zero and just about every idea from the
campaign came out of that session or their other ideas.

### D&D 2024

Although I was more interested in trying other indie TTRPGs coming off of two
long D&D campaigns, a lot of my one-shots this year were in D&D. This is in part
because it was what I was most familiar with and also because I started writing
adventures! Honestly though, after a lot of one-shots I am eager to get another
longer heroic high fantasy campaign going after a long break from that type of
storytelling.

## Looking to 2026

I'm not much of a new years resolution person but I did a
[bingo board](/2025-bingo) last year and really enjoyed that process of checking
things off a set of micro goals in various categories. The 5 TTRPG goals I set
for myself was actually my first BINGO! I plan to do that again this year and
this is my WIP list of TTRPG goals:

TTRPG

1. Run a 4-6 session PbtA campaign
1. GM a paid game
1. Self-publish a printed adventure zine
1. Self-publish an indie TTRPG
1. Release a new tool
