Just about every website and application nowadays has a dark mode toggle. It's a
great feature for people who prefer reading on a screen with dark backgrounds
and light text. Other people really like colorful gradients at slight angles and
the growing trend is "borrowing" [Stripe's](https://stripe.com) website design.
So today I'm launching both on my website!

Both the Dark and the Stripe themes are available in the theme switcher in my
site header. The dark mode provides a clean interface great for viewing without
the bright glaring lights of a lighter theme. And Stripe mode fills the need for
this site to have basically the same design as Stripe. Just head to the
[homepage](/) and tilt your head 15 degrees. Between operating systems offering
native support for dark theming and more and more sites yoinking all the CSS off
of stripe's homepage, it's imperative to offer those same experiences on my own
site.

If you're interested in seeing how it's implemented, you can check out my
website on [GitHub](https://github.com/kennygoff/kennygoff.com)! I use
[emotion](https://emotion.sh) for styling, and simply add a class name for each
team when loading the page. Dark mode is simple, but Stripe mode was a bit more
complex since I needed to add a lot of components and layout just to handle it.
Using emotion's parent selector syntax I was able to make the many modifications
needed to slap stripes on my page.

I originally used emotion-theming, but that had problems since Gatsby builds the
CSS on deploy. The simpler class name approach allowed me to overcome some
problems like the "style flashing" that occurs using emotion's built-in theming
provider without server-side rendering and the hollow emptiness of my personal
website looking like a Stripe clone. There's still some issues to work out, like
the inability to simply reference the "active" theme in CSS, like I could in
emotion's theme provider.
