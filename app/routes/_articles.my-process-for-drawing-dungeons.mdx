# My Process for Drawing Dungeons

I've been drawing dungeons for D&D for a little while now, and while I'm no
[Dyson](https://dysonlogos.blog/), I have a process that I've pieced together
over the last year or so. I won't go too in depth for how to _design_ a good
dungeon, as this post is mainly about the phases of my process, not design tips.

I'll be focusing on going from ideation to a digital map, but also done this in
pen-and-paper and sometimes do that for home games. For dungeons I make for
published adventures I tend to prefer the flexibility and undoability of
digital. That being said I find doing it all physically really rewarding and
much quicker since I'm less prone to being a perfectionist about it. Check out
the JP Coovert video at the end of this post for a video of him making a map
with pens!

## Phase 1: Dungeon Flow and Rooms

The first step is to start getting a structure for the dungeon. For my latest
adventure,
[_Rumble at the Hog & Hound_](https://sidequesters.club/adventures/rumble-at-the-hog-and-hound),
I tried sticking fairly closely to a
[5-Room Dungeon](https://www.roleplayingtips.com/5-room-dungeons/). At this
point I'm just getting a rough idea of rooms, monsters, and possible encounters.

Here's flowchart of sorts I put together in an Obsidian canvas, although many
times I just do this on a piece of paper with boxes and arrows. These are not
scenes that happen in a particular order, rather "rooms" that connect and can
players can discover in various ways.

## Phase 2: Initial Sketch

Here I will start doing the actual _layout_ and playing with room sizing and how
rooms connect. This is where having some sort of flow chart first helps me. I
find the chart is a better abstract visualization that I can use to inform how I
block out the map cartography itself. I tend to do this on grid paper with a
pencil. I'm still not going for high fidelity at this point, just a structure
that makes sense. I am fast and loose and erase and redraw _a lot_ here.

## Phase 3: Procreate Sketch Layer

Then I jump from pen and paper to Procreate on iPad. I do a blue line sketch
with a pencil brush here and for the most part stick to remaking my
pencil-and-paper sketch with a few other considerations in mind:

- How will map files be distributed and laid out for print or distribution?
- Are there any additional details I plan to add such as furniture or objects?
- Are there any secret doors or traps that need to be split into separate
  layers?
- Have I left enough space for text, keys, etc

Also make sure even if you're not initially planning to make them printable, you
probably want at least 300dpi and set your Drawing Grid spacing to one inch. My
first map I made this mistake at 75dpi and I didn't notice until the end of the
hours long drawing process. When I got around to printing the map for a playtest
it was woefully blurry.

## Phase 4: Procreate Final Detailed Drawing

This is the final stage where I add all the final line work and details above
the sketch layer. I normally do this in the following steps which also tend to
be what my layers are:

1. Big Bold Outlines
2. Doors, Stairs, and Windows
3. Objects
4. Crosshatching (if needed)
5. Grid/Tile detail lines
6. Shadows (if needed)

My Procreate brushes for this are still a big WIP but basically go I for a
bigger brush size for the big bold lines, and shrink it for the finer details.

I find this to be the longest individual stretch. Normally a pop on a podcast
and just go into "map drawing" mode for a couple of hours. Some of it can get
fairly tedious but it's also pretty relaxing. I'm still fairly slow at this
stage but I've definitely gotten quicker and built up a bit of muscle memory
after practicing a lot.

## Phase 5: Keying

The final step is that I take the base artwork and pull it into Figma to add
text and any room keys. I mainly do this out of habit I could probably do this
in Procreate, but I am just much more used to working in Figma for that type of
layout work.

## Conclusion

That's it! From there I normally export a keyed GM version and unkeyed and
secret-less player version. Like I said I'm no expert and I still have a lot to
learn, skills to practice, and many many many more maps to make.
