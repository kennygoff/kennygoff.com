# {attributes.title}

Picture this: You've just finished Lost Mines of Phandelver. Your fresh-faced
party took down The Black Spider and wants more. You want to keep the story
going but all you have is the free adventure in D&D Beyond or a starter set.
_What now?_

I enjoy doing my own worldbuilding and crafting quests, NPCs, and encounters.
But doing so as a new DM or one with limited time can be a lot of work. There's
plenty of published settings, adventure books, and homebrew you can find, but
maybe you want to dip your toe into writing your own stuff.

My favorite way to get started with writing your own campaign — and how I got
started as a DM — is to start off with a published adventure in an established
setting and build on that once the final quest from the book closes.

## Welcome to Phandalin, first time here?

When I was only a few months into DMing for the first time, I was thinking about
DMing a second group and I wasn't sure how much time I'd have to do a campaign
from scratch. I was already DMing one game and playing in another. Plus the
group would be all new players so I wasn't sure if they'd even like D&D or how
long our party would stick together. So I ran Lost Mines of Phandelver so I
could get started right away. By the end of the campaign I had a lot more
experience under my belt — but got stuck with this closing paragraph:

> If your players wish to continue playing their characters, you can use the
> contents of this set to create your own adventures; the mysterious map found
> in area 14 of Wave Echo Cave provides one possible adventure hook, but feel
> free to explore other ideas using the monsters, magic items, and locations in
> this adventure.

Not much to go off on, so here's some general tips as well as some campaign
specific ones you can leverage.

## General advice

- **Foreshadow** — If you have the foresight knowing you may run the campaign
  past the end of the book, drop hints and foreshadowing for future campaign
  beats. The nice thing about this is your players won't remember everything so
  you don't have to actually use it once it comes time to implement. Sprinkle
  foreshadowing all about and only use what sticks or interests your players.
- **_Retroactively_ foreshadow** — Sometimes you may not have the foresight to
  plan ahead or you just want to focus on the adventure as written. Instead,
  pick something the players find or do and retroactively give it meaning later.
  Maybe it's a random item the players find that you later decide belonged to a
  villain who wants it back and hunts down the players.
- **Unused sidequests and rumors** — This is less "your own adventure" but
  moreso picking and chosing from the book what you want without the "burden" of
  having it be relevant to the main plot. This might be the perfect way to
  continue if your players were focused only on the immediately important main
  plot and avoided side quests. They also serve as nice palette cleansers or
  fillers for you to give you time to write your own adventures.
- **Spotlight an NPC** — Give underused NPCs who had little to do as written
  their own quest or story. This is a good one because every party will have
  unique interactions with NPCs so an NPC the book wrote as a one off character
  might be the party's best friend.
- **The Bigger, Badder Evil Guy** — You can always pull "the boss was working
  for someone even more powerful". It's a bit of a cliche but it gives your
  players immediate motivation and a strong tie to the new big bad. Maybe it's
  not just the boss's boss but a rival who's path has been cleared to expand
  territories. Use the villain's defeat as the spark of a new villain's rise.

## Lost Mines of Phandelver hooks

The book mentions a few hooks for future play such as a mysterious map in Wave
Echo Cave or the return of Glasstaff. Here's some not explicitly left by the
book that I used in my campaign.

- **Thundertree, Reidoth & Venomfang** — Thundertree is a fun side quest, but
  not every party will run into this rumor or choose to go on it. My party
  skipped on it, focusing on the main plot threads, so I used it as the opening
  thread to our second adventure arc. Plus if you can have them fight Venomfang
  at a higher level, they could defeat the dragon, rather than him fleeing at
  half HP as the book suggests.
- **Leverage unexplored areas of Sword Coast** — Sword Coast has a vibrant
  history in D&D lore and it's already fleshed out as a setting. Just on the map
  given in Phandelver are unused locales in the city of Neverwinter, Mount
  Hotenow, and The Crags, among others. You can also check out the
  [Forgotten Realms fandom wiki](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sword_Coast_North)
  for some quick location inspiration if you don't want to make up your own
  villages and fortresses. I set the next arc of my campaign in my own villages
  and dungeons within Kryptgarden Forest, an area just south of Phandalin
  unutilized by the book.
- **The Black Spider's Boss** — Maybe the Black Spider was working for yet
  another mysterious benefactor or he was part of a group of evil mages that is
  pissed he's dead. Use the fact that he's a drow to your advantage: they are
  matriarchal so tease that this guy was just an a footsoldier for a stronger
  woman in charge. I pulled this move and set up a fun drow-centric and
  underdark-delving adventure for my players to go on.

Whatever you decide to do, don't end the campaign because you finished the book!
Let the events of your campaign be the seeds for a new adventure. It's easier
than starting from a blank page anyway.
